  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hello! I'm Yasin Okat, a dedicated professional specializing in electronics and software. With a solid foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, thanks to my Bachelor's degree from Eskişehir Osmangazi University, I bring a wealth of technical knowledge to the table.</p>
  <p>My career goal is to secure a challenging position that aligns with my interests, allowing me to apply my skills and gain valuable experience. I'm truly passionate about leveraging my expertise to contribute to innovative projects in the electronics and software industries.</p>
  <p>When it comes to language skills, I have advanced proficiency in English, both in reading, speaking, and writing. I have also achieved an impressive score of 93.75/100 in the YDS 2021 exam. Additionally, I possess beginner-level skills in German and am a native Turkish speaker.</p>
  <p>In terms of computer skills, I'm proficient in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C. My expertise lies particularly in Java and Python, where I have above-average skills. Additionally, I have average skills in SQL and C. I'm well-versed in using a range of tools, including Proteus, TIA Portal, Excel, Android Studio, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, MSSQL Server, and PostgreSQL. I'm also experienced in working with both GNU/Linux and Windows operating systems.</p>
  <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have gained valuable experience through previous work and internships. As an IT Specialist at Movus Logistics, I developed an Android app using Java and effectively utilized JSON for web service communication. Additionally, I created a Python-based web service using the Flask library to seamlessly interact with the IIS web server and MSSQL database server. Automation played a significant role in my work, where I scripted various tasks using Python. For example, I developed an Excel automation script and implemented network automation. During my tenure at Movus Logistics, I discovered and resolved a vulnerability in the company's software by effectively addressing SQL injections.</p>
  <p>Prior to that, I interned at Anot Endüstri ve Ticaret A.Ş., where I played a pivotal role in developing PLC automation systems for clients using Siemens TIA Portal. I successfully tackled various challenges within ladder logic systems, gaining practical experience in this domain.</p>
  <p>One of my notable projects during my academic journey was the Image Processing Project, which formed a crucial part of my graduation project at Eskişehir Osmangazi University. For this project, I developed a Python software application that utilized advanced image processing techniques to assist visually impaired individuals in reading books. Leveraging libraries such as pytesseract, numpy, and gTTS, I created an effective solution that showcased my abilities.</p>
  <p>In summary, I'm a motivated and skilled professional with a strong academic background and practical experience in the fields of electronics and software. I constantly seek opportunities to enhance my skills further and contribute to meaningful projects. With a strong drive to make a positive impact in the industry, I'm excited to leverage my knowledge and expertise to drive innovation and success.</p>
